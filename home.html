                A number of factors have contributed to the rise of video in web design. An abundance of video editing software,
                 faster internet connections, and improved browser performance have allowed web designers everywhere to integrate 
                 video into their designs. In addition, the increasing number of
                 free stock videos and decreasing video production costs has meant that quality
                  motion content is much more accessible now than it ever was before. But most importantly,
                   designers have begun to recognize the power video has on the viewer. Motion, movement, animation â€” 
                   all are guaranteed to keep a digital audience transfixed much more effectively than static elements.
